This improves upon my other NCCN guidelines notebook, as this directly access the latest NCCN guideline, so you don't have to worry about not having the latest in your PDF folder.
It also does a quick Google search and incorporates the results for recency and enhanced information. 

To run this, you do need a [https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key](Google GenAI API-key) and of course, your [https://www.nccn.org/Register](NCCN username and password).
