# NCCN-Guidelines-Google-GenAI-Capstone

This is the capstone submitted after taking the Google Five-day Intensive GenAI course (April 2025).
The full description of this project is written up here:

This improves upon my other NCCN guidelines notebook, as this directly access the latest NCCN guideline, so you don't have to worry about not having the latest in your PDF folder.
It also does a quick Google search and incorporates the results for recency and enhanced information. 

To run this, you do need a Google GenAI API-key (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) and of course, your NCCN username and password (https://www.nccn.org/Register). 

For physicians: install Jupyter Lab at https://jupyter.org.

Store your Google API key, NCCN username and password in a simple text file called keys.env like this:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxxx

NCCN_username=yyyy

NCCN_password=zzzz

Then in Terminal, launch jupyter lab (or jupyter notebook).
